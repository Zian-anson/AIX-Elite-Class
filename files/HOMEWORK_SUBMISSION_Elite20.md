## Requirement Checklist

### ✅ Task 2 — Personal GitHub Fork with ≥3 commits

**Fork created:** https://github.com/Detachment5879/neoskills  
**Total own commits:** 6 (exceeds minimum 3)

| # | Commit | Message | File(s) |
|---|--------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `8106675` | `docs: add student fork attribution section to README` | `README.md` |
| 2 | `5108f21` | `chore: improve .gitignore with dev caches, editor files, and env patterns` | `.gitignore` |
| 3 | `5b10708` | `docs: add homework submission document` | `HOMEWORK_SUBMISSION.md` |
| 4 | `efe24d9` | `docs: update commit hashes in homework submission document` | `HOMEWORK_SUBMISSION.md` |
| 5 | `7ca4e5d` | `docs: update submission doc with 4th commit info` | `HOMEWORK_SUBMISSION.md` |
| 6 | `a34b25e` | `feat: complete Tasks 4-6 — KSTAR loop, artifact, AI+X 3D card` | 6 files |

**Git status:** Working tree clean, all pushed to `origin/main`.

---

### ✅ Task 3 — Invoked at least one Skill, read one SKILL.md

**Skill invoked & read:** `skills/bank-status/SKILL.md`

Read end-to-end: frontmatter (name, description) → Instructions (4 steps) → Output Format (4 sections) → Quick Commands (3 suggestions).

**Key learnings from SKILL.md structure:**
- Uses YAML frontmatter (name, description, tags)
- Instructions section — numbered steps for the agent
- Output Format section — structured response template
- Can include optional scripts/ directory for automation

---

### ✅ Task 4 — One full K→S→T→A→R Loop on a real task

**Task:** Create a new neoskills skill (`git-snapshot`) from scratch

**Trace file:** `trace-kstar-loop.md`

| Phase | What happened |
|-------|---------------|
| **K**nowledge | Knew neoskills skill structure from existing examples |
| **S**earch | Searched `skills/bank-status/SKILL.md` and `skills/skill-dedup/SKILL.md` for format reference |
| **T**hink | Decided on `git-snapshot` name, 3-step instruction format, structured output |
| **A**ct | Created `skills/git-snapshot/SKILL.md` with frontmatter + instructions + output format |
| **R**eflect | Identified future improvements (scripts/, ontology.yaml) |

**Deliverable:** `skills/git-snapshot/SKILL.md` — a skill that captures git repository status snapshots

---

### ✅ Task 5 — Shipped one small artifact with full trace

**Artifact:** `scripts/ns-summary.py`

**What it does:** A pure-Python CLI tool that prints a compact summary of the neoskills project:
- Project metadata (name, version, remote, branch)
- Repository stats (file counts by type, total lines)
- Skill inventory (from `skills/` directory)
- Recent git activity (last 5 commits, ahead/behind, uncommitted changes)

**Why it's useful:** The neoskills project has 300+ files. This gives you a one-command overview.

**Trace file:** `trace-artifact-ns-summary.md`

**Design principles:**
- Zero external dependencies (pure Python 3)
- Portable (runs from anywhere with `--path` flag)
- Graceful fallbacks if git commands fail

---

### ✅ Task 6 — AI+X 3D Framework Location + Coordinate Card

**Coordinate card:** `ai-x-3d-coordinate-card.md`

**3D position:** **(0.7, 0.8, 0.6)**

| Axis | Score | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| 🔵 X-domain (专业领域) | 0.7 | CS/Software Engineering, AI Agents |
| 🟢 AI-tooling (AI工具链) | 0.8 | Heavy Claude Code + GitHub + Python |
| 🟠 Self/Reflection (自我定位) | 0.6 | Explorer → Builder transition |

**Self-assessment:** High tool proficiency, moderate domain depth, growing autonomy. Next milestone is designing a CLI tool architecture independently.
